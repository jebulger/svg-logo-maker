# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
As my applications are beginning to become more sophisticated, I need to be able to use my own logos, so that I do not have to worry about paying for one. This project began with the goal of creating an application that would generate logos for my applications. This helps to save time (and money) when working on applications, so the focus can be kept on the code itself. The project itself runs inside the terminal. Upon running the app, prompts will appear asking for input on how the logo should look. Once the prompts are answered, you will see the dynamically generated 'logo.svg' inside the 'examples' folder.

## Installation
A source-code editor (such as VS Code, etc.) and a command line tool (such as Git Bash, etc.) is required to use the application.
## Usage
Steps to use upon checking out code:
1. Inside your terminal, cd into the project's root directory '/svg-logo-maker'.
2. Run the command 'node index.js' to begin the prompts.
3. The prompts will appear in the terminal, enter your inputs there.
4. Upon answering all of the prompts, a message will appear letting you know that the SVG has been generated. 
5. You will then find it inside of the 'examples' folder, and you now have your dynamically generated logo to use as you see fit!
